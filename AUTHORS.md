pfam-dom-draw was created by [Kristian Gray](https://github.com/KrisGray) in 2015 at the HGNC, the organsation responsible for approving unique symbols and names for human loci, including protein coding genes, RNA genes and pseudogenes, to allow unambiguous scientific communication.

A big THANK YOU to the developers within the [Pfam](http://pfam.xfam.org/) team who created the REST API that pfam-dom-draw is built upon.
